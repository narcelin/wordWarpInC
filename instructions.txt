You will use 3 character arrays:
• Jumbled word
• Solution word
• Guess word
• The jumbled word and the solution word will be read from an input file
• The user will be presented with the jumbled word
• The user will have 3 chances to guess the word
• If the user does not guess the word on the first guess, the first and last letters will be provided
• See the sample output below
• Be sure to greet the user and say goodbye to the user
• Be sure to change all 3 character arrays to all uppercase letters –
• use the toupper function from ctype.h, one character at a time
• You will use %s to scanf (no &) and print the words
• You will use the strlen and strcmp functions from string.h
• You will use a do/while loop in the main function
