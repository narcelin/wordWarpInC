Algorithm: Wordle Guessing Game

1. Initialize three character arrays:
   - jumbledWord (jumbledWord) 
   - solutionWord (solutionWord)
   - guessWord (guessWord)

2. Open an input file and read the jumbledWord and solutionWord from the files.
   - Use fscanf to read the words from the file into the corresponding arrays.
   - Close jumbledWord and solutionWord files.
   - Convert each character to uppercase using toupper function.

3. Greet the user:
   - Print a welcome message.

4. Set the number of chances (chancesLeft) to 3.

5. Start a do/while loop:
   - Print the jumbled word for the user to guess.

   - Prompt the user to enter their guess:
      > Read user input and save into guessWord.

   - Convert each character of guessWord to uppercase.

   - Compare the guessWord with the solutionWord using strcmp.

   - If the guess is correct:
      > Print a congratulatory message.
      > Exit the loop.

   - If the guess is incorrect:
      > Decrement chancesLeft.
      > Provide hint on first attempt 
        - HINT: print the first and last letters of the solutionWord.
      > Print the remaining chances.

   - If chancesLeft is zero:
      > Print a message indicating that the user has run out of chances.
      > Print the correct solution.

6. Say goodbye to the user:
   - Print a farewell message.

7. Close the input file.
